<p align="left"><h1>Abstract</h1>

In the current pandemic stricken world, lockdowns and preventative measures are enforced on the daily. As observed over the past two years, the conscious effort to ensure one's safety is often ignored over one's desire to lead the same lifestyle as the one prior to the pandemic. This game serves as a reminder that the pandemic remains to be a health hazard and precautions need to observed. Moreover, since quantum computation is in its infancy with research developments occurring on the daily, beginners might have a hard time comprehending how qubits and qubit gates work. This game can be used to comprehend how a quantum circuits are implemented both on simulators and real quantum computers.

<p align="left"><ol> <h2>How to play the game:</h2>
 <ol>
  <li>On entering the game, the player is prompted to open the menu which contains a list of options. They can choose between the single qubit gates: Hadamard gate, Pauli X gate, Pauli Y gate ,Pauli Z gate and RZ gate. In addition, multi qubit gate such as  the CNOT gate has been included.</li>
  <li>On selection of the gate from the menu, the gate is applied to the qubit. For every gate added onto the qubit, points are deducted from the score value.</li>
  <li>The game terminates either when a maximum of eleven gates are used or the score point has been depleted to zero</li>
  <li>The qubits are measured and if the player manages to attain the required probability of a certain state, they win and a winning message is displayed. </li>

The code was implemented using qiskit and pygame and subsequently simulated on the IonQ simulator. In order to access the code, download the files, install qiskit and run (filenametoadd).
