<p><h1>Abstract</h1>

In the current pandemic ~(maybe like concentrated)~ world we live in, lockdowns and preventative measures are enforced on the daily. As observed over the past two years, the measures taken to ensure one's safety are often ignored over the desire to ~"live one's dreams"~. This game serves as a reminder that the pandemic is ~very~ much an ongoing health hazard and proper measures need to observed. In addition, with quantum computation being in its infancy, beginners who tend to understand concepts kinetically can use this game to understand how a quantum circuit and be implemented.

<p><ol><h2>How to play the game:</h2>
 <ol><li>On entering the game, the player is prompted to open the menu which contains a list of options. They can choose between  the single qubit gates: Hadamard gate, Pauli X gate, Pauli Y gate ,Pauli Z gate and RZ gate. In addition, multi qubit gate such as  the CNOT gate has been included.</li>
<li>On selection of the gate from the menu, the gate is applied to the qubit</li>
<li>The player can a maximum of 11 gates after which the game terminates</li>
<li>The qubits are measured and if the player manages to attain the required probability of a certain state, they win and a winning message is displayed.</li><ol></p>
 </ol></p>


<p><h1>Implementation Details</h1>

The code was implemented using qiskit and pygame and subsequently simulated on the IonQ simulator.
